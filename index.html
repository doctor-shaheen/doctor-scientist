                    <aside class="notes">
                        My journey in research began early in medical school, fueled by a desire to bridge clinical understanding with scientific discovery. I gained foundational hands-on experience in basic science, working as a research assistant in an animal physiology lab where I learned rodent handling, behavioral experiments, brain dissection, and even introductory stereotactic surgery techniques and basic molecular biology methods like Western Blot. This provided me with a crucial understanding of experimental design and wet-lab work, culminating in my first publications.

                     <aside class="notes">
                        As I progressed through medical training, my interest expanded to clinical research. I worked as a clinical research assistant, gaining exposure to patient data and study protocols. Simultaneously, I began developing strong quantitative skills, focusing on biostatistics and research methodology, which I later taught to fellow researchers.

					<h2>The Computational Pivot</h2>
					<p>The COVID-19 lockdown became a catalyst for growth.</p>
					<p class="fragment">I immersed myself in the world of <strong>data science, machine learning, and programming</strong>, recognizing it as the future of medical discovery.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        My passion for analyzing complex data led me to computational neuroscience and machine learning. I immersed myself in learning programming (R, Python) and applying advanced AI and statistical modeling techniques, particularly for analyzing neurophysiological (EEG/MEG) and neuroimaging (MRI) data. My postdoctoral research allowed me to delve deeper into this area, investigating brain dynamics and aging using these methods.

                        Currently, while completing my medical internship, I remain deeply engaged in research. I am looking to combine my clinical knowledge, foundational science background, and advanced computational skills to not only answer important research questions but also to build ventures that can translate these findings into real-world impact.
